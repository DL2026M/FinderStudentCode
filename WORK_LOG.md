| October 30th |  2:00pm - 3:00pm  | I began brainstorming on how to solve this solve problem by creating my own way. In addition, Mr. Blick explained the beginning of the problem and that I needed to built a table that has the ability to lookup data in constant time. This requires not only the searching algorithm to be fast, but also for the table to be built in a way that increases overall speed. |
| November 2nd |  6:00pm - 6:45pm  | I continued brainstorming efficient two way tables but didn't find anything that was obvious. One of the two way tables that I found was called "Apache Commons DualHashBidiMap". I am still trying to figure out how to make a really efficient table because I think that it is super important. |
| November 2nd |  6:45pm - 7:30pm  | I thought more about the lookup algorithm during this part. I did this by writing a couple of examples on my whiteboard and trying to see the best way to lookup assuming it was a normal table. I think that I need to create a table first before I can do more work on the algorithm as it could change if my table set up changes. |
| November 5th | 11:00am - 12:00pm | I basically finished my HashMap class during classtime and began working on Finder. I need to make sure that my adding function is correct in HashMap as I wrote it pretty quickly and there is a definitely a chance that it's wrong. I am looking forward to writing the rest of my code and getting this working! |
| November 7th |  3:00pm - 4:00pm  | I had a super helpful meeting with Mr. Blick during this time where he helped debug my code and gave me suggestions to improve. First, we fixed the resize class by wrapping around and a while loop that checked to if the key at the new hashed value existed. Second, we finished finder class (which was very short). |
| November 8th |  4:00pm - 5:00pm  | I got all of my code finally working! I had to make a lot of changes from what it was last time I worked on it as I kept on getting random errors. I played around with the default table size and landed on 1609 and kept the load factor at 50%. The code works and is completed! |
