| October 30th |  2:00pm - 3:00pm  | I began brainstorming on how to solve this solve problem by creating my own way. In addition, Mr. Blick explained the beginning of the problem and that I needed to built a table that has the ability to lookup data in constant time. This requires not only the searching algorithm to be fast, but also for the table to be built in a way that increases overall speed. |
| November 2nd |  6:00pm - 6:45pm  |                                                                           I continued brainstorming efficient two way tables but didn't find anything that was obvious. One of the two way tables that I found was called "Apache Commons DualHashBidiMap". I am still trying to figure out how to make a really efficient table because I think that it is super important. |
| November 2nd |  6:45pm - 7:30pm  |                                       I thought more about the lookup algorithm during this part. I did this by writing a couple of examples on my whiteboard and trying to see the best way to lookup assuming it was a normal table. I think that I need to create a table first before I can do more work on the algorithm as it could change if my table set up changes. |
| November 5th | 11:00am - 12:00pm |                                                         I basically finished my HashMap class during classtime and began working on Finder. I need to make sure that my adding function is correct in HashMap as I wrote it pretty quickly and there is a definitely a chance that it's wrong. I am looking forward to writing the rest of my code and getting this working! |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
