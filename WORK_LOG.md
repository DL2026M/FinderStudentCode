| October 30th | 2:00pm - 3:00pm | I began brainstorming on how to solve this solve problem by creating my own way. In addition, Mr. Blick explained the beginning of the problem and that I needed to built a table that has the ability to lookup data in constant time. This requires not only the searching algorithm to be fast, but also for the table to be built in a way that increases overall speed.  |

To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
